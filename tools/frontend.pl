% First you have to keep this file in a folder called "PFC"
% Then open swi Prolog and write "interpreter('funcionesBasicas.xml','output4.xml',potencia)." to test it

% Funcion principal, se le puede meter el fichero de entrada y salida, o incluirle tambi√©n
% las variables inf, sup y maxDepth, si no se incluyen se ponen por defecto a: -3, 3 y 10
